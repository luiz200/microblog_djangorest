Start the development server:

$ python manage.py runserver

Using Insomnia for Data Insertion
Insomnia is an API testing tool that allows you to send HTTP requests to your server. Follow the steps below to use Insomnia for data insertion in the DjangoRESTFramework application.

Download and install Insomnia: https://insomnia.rest/

Open Insomnia and click on "Create" to create a new workspace.

Select the "POST" method to create a new request.

Enter the endpoint URL for data insertion, for example: http://localhost:8000/api/data/.

In the "Headers" panel, add the Content-Type header with the value application/json.

In the "Body" panel, select the "JSON" option and enter the data you want to insert in JSON format. For example:

json
Copy code
{
  "field1": "value1",
  "field2": "value2",
  "field3": "value3"
}
Click on "Send" to send the request.

Check the response received from the server to verify if the data was successfully inserted.

Final Notes
With this guide, you can use Insomnia to insert data into the DjangoRESTFramework application easily and quickly. Make sure to run the development server before sending the requests. If you have any questions or issues, refer to the official DjangoRESTFramework documentation or seek help from the developer community.
